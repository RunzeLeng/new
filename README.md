I've been asked not to contact you anymore, but i really have a lot of words want to say to you.  

I don't blame you for reporting me, I still like you, but i just can't be with you right now.

From my previous experience, I just can not accept myself to be the intruder of other people's relationship. It not only makes me recall bad memories, but also makes all my struggles before seem worthless. if i accept you now, i don't know how to face myself.
